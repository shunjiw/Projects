This project is to build a binary classifer to detect whether a transaction is fraudlent using machine learning techniques. 

The biggest challenge is that the dataset is extremely imbalanced. 
To deal with the imbalanced data, I proposed two approaches:
1. Oversample the data with SMOTE algorithm and then use Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest to train the oversampled data.
2. Utilize the Weighted Random Forest and Weighted SVM on the original training set.

Besides, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest are implemented directly on the original train set as the baseline method.
The model performance will be evaluated by ROC-AUC.
We will compare the models to determine which method fits the data best.

The project is mainly divided into four tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Oversampling with SMOTE
3. Modeling 
4. Comparison and Conclusion
