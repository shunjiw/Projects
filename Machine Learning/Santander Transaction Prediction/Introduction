Santander Consumer Transaction Prediction is a Kaggle Competition project. 
The goal is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. 

The data provided has the same structure as the real data Santander have available to solve this problem. 
The data has already been spilt into training and test set. 
The training set has 200,000 rows and 202 columns, 
which include 200 variables containing numeric feature variables, the binary target variable, and a string ID_code column.
The test set has 200,000 rows as well and has 201 columns, 
which include the same variables as the training set expect the target.

Before modeling, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis including data summary, hypothesis testing and data visualizations. 
All the 200 variables are numeric and contain no missing values. Besides, Feature Engineering is omitted considering that the variables are anonymous

In the modeling part, the ROC-AUC is chosen as evaluation metrics as required by the Kaggle competition. 
I implemented three tree-based methods, Adaboost, XGBoost and LightGBM, to predict whether a customer will make a transaction.  

After modeling, I compared the model performance and decided the LightGBM model, which achieves a 0.899 AUC, as the final model.
