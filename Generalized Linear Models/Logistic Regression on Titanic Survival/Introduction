The sinking of RMS Titanic is a huge tragedy, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive 
than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

We obtain the passengers record from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. In the dataset, 891 passengers are included in the dataset. 
In addition to the passenger number and survival status, there are other ten relative variables, such as Age, Sex and Cabin Number. 

Our task is to figure out who is more likely to survive this tragedy based on their personal information. 
The logistic regression is carried out to handle this challenge.
