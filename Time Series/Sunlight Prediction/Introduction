The goal of this project is to fit the sunlight data using an appropriate time series model and make predictions for the future.

Steps:

1. Conduct the time series data analysis. Explore the trend and seasonality by data visualizations. 

2. Difference the data and generate the ACF and PACF plots to find the potentially appropriate models. 

3. Fit the candidate time series models on the train set and conduct model selection by Cross Validation.

4. Assess model performance on the test set by MSE and decide the final model.


Alternatively, try tree-based Random Forest model to build the predictive model 
by taking the variables such as temperature and cloud type as the predictors and the GHI value as the response.
