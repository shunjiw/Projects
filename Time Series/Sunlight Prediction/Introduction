The goal of this project is to fit the sunlight data using an appropriate time series model and make predictions for the future.

The data is stored in 5 csv files, each of which is one-year sunlight data.
There are 18 variables, such as Temperature, Cloud Type and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).
Each row in the dataset represents a record of one half hour in a specific day. 

I preprocessed the dataset by merging and aggregating the data so that the final dataset contains all five years' information 
and each row represents a daily record before starting the following analysis.


Steps:

1. Conduct the time series data analysis. Explore the trend and seasonality by data visualizations. 

2. Difference the data and generate the ACF and PACF plots to find the potentially appropriate models. 

3. Fit the candidate time series models on the train set and conduct model selection by Cross Validation.

4. Assess model performance on the test set by MSE and decide the final model.


Alternatively, try tree-based Random Forest model to build the predictive model. 
The variables like Temperature and Cloud Type are treated as the predictors and the GHI value is the response.
